# SpinachLibraryX

Welcome to **SpinachLibraryX**, a collection of resources designed to enhance your experience with spin dynamics simulations and magnetic resonance spectroscopy.

## Prerequisites

To use these files effectively, please ensure you have access to the following resources:

- **[Spinach](http://spindynamics.org/):**  
  An open-source spin dynamics simulation library supporting NMR, EPR, MRI, and other forms of magnetic resonance spectroscopy.  

- **[NMRbox](https://nmrbox.org/):**  
  A comprehensive platform for biomolecular NMR software, providing tools, documentation, tutorials, and cloud-based virtual machines.

To ensure proper functionality and organization of the `C13_1D[X]()` files, please adhere to the following rules:

1. **Remove `[X]` from File Names and Function Names**  
   - Update all `C13_1D[X]()` files by removing the `[X]` placeholder from both the **file names** and the **function names**.
